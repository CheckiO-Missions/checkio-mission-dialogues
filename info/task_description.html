Modern world is full of means of communication - social networks, messengers, phone calls, SMS etc.
But sometimes every communication channel show own problem and you think at moments like that: "I should create my own messenger - without any promblems like this one".<br>
In this mission you have such opportunity.<br>
Your task is to create a Chat class which could help Human(name) and Robot(serial_number) to make a conversation. This class should have a few methods:<br>
<strong>connect_human()</strong> - connect human to the chat.<br>
<strong>connect_robot()</strong> - connect robot to the chat.<br>
<strong>show_human_dialogue()</strong> - shows the dialogue as it looks to the human - as simple text.<br>
<strong>show_robot_dialogue()</strong> - shows the dialogue as it looks to the robot - as the set of the 1 and 0. To simplify the task, just replace every vowel ('aeiouAEIOU') with "0", and the rest symbols (consonants and special signs like ",", "!" etc.) with "1".<br>
Dialogue for human shoud be shown like this:<br>
(human name) said: message text<br>
(robot serial number): message text<br>
For robot:<br>
(human name) said: 11100100011<br>
(robot serial number) said: 100011100101<br>
Interlocutors should have a method <strong>send()</strong> for sending a messages to the dialogue.<br>
In this mission you could use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern'>Mediator</a> design pattern.

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
chat = Chat()
karl = Human("Karl")
bot = Robot("R2D2")
chat.connect_human(karl)
chat.connect_robot(bot)
karl.send("Hi! What's new?")
bot.send("Hello. Could we speak later about it?")
chat.show_human_dialogue() == """Karl said: Hi! Whatâ€™s new?
R2D2 said: Hello, human. Could we speak later about it?"""
chat.show_robot_dialogue() == """Karl said: 101111011111011
R2D2 said: 10110111010111100111101110011101011010011011"""
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>Interlocutors and the text of the messages.
</p>

<p>
