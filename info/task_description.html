Modern world is full of means of communication - social networks, messengers, phone calls, SMS etc.
But sometimes every communication channel show own problem and you think at moments like that: "I should create my own messenger - without any promblems like this one".<br>
In this mission you have such opportunity.<br>
Your task is to create a NewMessenger class which could help two person (Person1 and Person2) to make a conversation. This class should have method <strong>connect_person()</strong> for adding person in the dialogue and <strong>show_dialogue()</strong> to print out the dialogue as a multiline string. Every single line shold looks like:<br>
Person1 (or Person2) said: text of the message<br>
Interlocutors should have a method <strong>send()</strong> for sending a messages to the dialogue.<br>
In this mission you could use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern'>Mediator</a> design pattern.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
messenger = NewMessenger()
karl = Person1(messenger)
peter = Person2(messenger)
messenger.connect_person(karl)
messenger.connect_person(peter)
karl.send("Hi! What's new?")
peter.send('Hello. Could we speak later about it?')
messenger.show_dialogue() == '''Person1 said: Hi! Whatâ€™s new?
Person2 said: Hello. Could we speak later about it?'''
</pre>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>Interlocutors and the text of the messages.
</p>

<p>
